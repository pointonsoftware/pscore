## Getting Started

The repository consists of three main folders and their subfolders:
 - **core**
    - domain - business workflow and components
    - entity - business entities
 - **orchestra**
    - application - presentation layer
    - datamanager - database queries
    - migration   - stack database
 - **utility** - helper classes like logger, fileio, etc.

---

### Pre-requisites

These are the base requirements to build and use CORE.
 - Cmake
 - C++11-standard-compliant compiler

---

### Download

Clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone git@github.com:pointonsoftware/pscore.git`

---

### How to build in Linux

- Run `clean_build.sh`
- Generated/output files are in pscore/build folder

---

### How to build in Windows

- Open the root CMakeLists.txt file with your favorite IDE.
- Hit Build!

---

### Usage

#### Libraries
- Go to your build directory
- The build generates **domain** libraries that contain the CORE use cases. These libraries can be linked to any executable.

#### Executable
- Go to your build directory
- Inside the **bin** folder, run **console_app**.
- This application is used to test the CORE APIs.

---

### Screenshots

- **Unreleased version** asks for the user's name and print it in the console using the logger utility class.

## Contributing

A developer guide document is available in the [doc folder](doc/Developer%20Guide.docx) and can be used to setup the project.  
 
 Once able to build, you can make your changes and submit a pull request!

---

### Make a Pull Request

Make sure that your master branch is up to date with CORE's master branch:
```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Create your feature/developement branch and work on your change in this branch:
```
git checkout -b dev/[yourbranchname]
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!
```
git pull --rebase origin master
git push -u origin dev/[yourbranchname]
```

Finally, go to GithHub and [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!  

Travis-CI and GitHub actions will try to build and run several tests on your pull request. We care about quality, so your PR won't be merged until all tests pass.

---

### Merging a Pull Request

A PR can only be merged into master if:
 - It has passed CI.
 - It has been approved by at least one maintainer.
 - It has no requested changes.
 - It is up to date with current master branch.  

The PR author is allowed to merge the PR if all of these conditions are met.
